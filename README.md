# Lens, State is your father... and I can prove it!

About a year ago, we published ["Lens, State Is Your
Father"](https://blog.hablapps.com/2016/11/10/lens-state-is-your-father/) in
this blog. It led us to [our first contribution to
Monocle](https://github.com/julien-truffaut/Monocle/pull/415) and sowed the
seeds of [Stateless](https://github.com/hablapps/stateless), the Scala library
that we are currently working on. The post left some questions opened, which
we'll try to address today. Particularly, we have set two goals:

* Proving the major claim from the original post: an instance of `MonadState` with `State[S, ?]` and `A` as type arguments has a direct correspondence with a `Lens[S, A]`.
* Contextualizing the relevance of a proof assistant like [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/) in functional programming.

**It doesn't matter if you haven't read the previous post**, we'll help you to
catch up with a brief recapitulation. Let's go for it!

## 1. Recap

In the aforementioned post, we claimed the existence of some connections between
lenses and the state monad. So, first of all, we'll introduce these elements.

A lens is just a pair of methods packed together, one of them to *get* a part
from a bigger whole and another one to *put* a new version of the part in an old
whole, returning a new whole. We, as programmers, are very familiar with those
methods, since they correspond with the notion of *getter* and *setter*,
respectively. However, to avoid name conflicts with other definitions, we'll
refer to them as `view` and `update`. We can encode a lens in Scala as follows:

```Scala
case class Lens[S, A](
  view: S => A,
  update: S => A => S)
```

_(*) Notice that the "whole" data structure is represented with an `S`, while the
"part" is represented with an `A`._

Lenses are extremely useful to update [nested data
structures](http://julien-truffaut.github.io/Monocle/optics/lens.html), but we
won't go further down that road today. Instead, we'll focus on the properties
that a lens must hold to be considered very well-behaved:

```Scala
viewUpdate:   update(s)(view(s)) = s
updateView:   view(update(s)(a)) = a
updateUpdate: update(update(s)(a1))(a2) = update(s)(a2)
```

So, a very well-behaved lens is any instance of `Lens` whose `view` and `update`
methods are compliant with the previous laws.

On the other hand, there is `MonadState`. It's a [widespread
typeclass](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/jeremy.gibbons/publications/utp-monads.pdf)
that classifies all those effects which are able to access and manipulate an
inner state. To do so, this typeclass contains a pair of methods, the first of
them to get the current state and the second one to replace it with a new
version. We'll be using the terms *get* and *put* to refer to these new methods.
Having said so, this is how we encode this typeclass in Scala (where `A`
corresponds with the type of the inner state):

```Scala
trait MonadState[A, M[_]] extends Monad[M] {
  def get: M[A]
  def put: A => M[Unit]
}
```

As usual, this typeclass comes along with some properties that any instance
should satisfy. We show them here:

```Scala
getGet: get >>= (a1 => get >>= (a2 => point((a1, a2)))) =
        get >>= (a => point((a, a)))
getPut: get >>= put = point(())
putGet: put a >>= get = put a >>= point(a)
putPut: put a1 >> put a2 = put a2
```

_(*) Notice that `>>=` and `point` correspond with the `Monad` methods, which
are also known as `bind` and `return` in the folklore, respectively._

The most popular instance of this typeclass is `State`, which is just a state transformation that produces additional output `A`:

```Scala
case class State[S, A](runState: S => (A, S))

def stateMonadState[S] = new MonadState[S, State[S, ?]] {
  def get = State(s => (s, s))
  def put = s => State(_ => ((), s))
}
```

Now, we have all the ingredients to state our claim. In fact, you might have
noticed that `Lens` and `MonadState` show a high degree of similarity, which
embraces not only their methods but also their associated laws. However, they're
quite different beasts: lenses deal with immutable data structures while
`MonadState` handles monadic effects. In the original post, we were surprised to
find out that `MonadState` generalises a lens. Indeed, we suggested that
instantiating `MonadState` sith `State` is just an alternative way of
representing a lens:

```Scala
type MSLens[S, A] = MonadState[A, State[S, ?]]
```

In the next section, we will prove it right, both informally and formally.
Later, in the concluding section, we'll argue why this connection is important
to us.

## 2. Proof of Paternity

Now, it's time for us to prove our claim! Remember, we want to assert that any
instance of `MonadState` with `State` is just a lens. Firstly, we'll do it
informally, old school style, though using a pseudo-scala notation. Then, we'll
formalise it with Coq. Since the proof would take too much writing, we'll just
show you a subpart of it, and we'll reference the rest of them.

### Informal Proof

So, where should we start? Well, we want to check that `MonadState[A, State[S, ?]]`
is just a lens. Thereby, it would be helpful if we could provide a function to
evidence that mapping:

```Scala
def ms_2_ln[S, A](ms: MonadState[A, State[S, ?]]): Lens[S, A] =
  Lens[S, A](
    view = s => evalState(get)(s),
    update = s => a => execState(put(a))(s))
```

where `execState` and `evalState` are just convenience methods to simplify the
implementation:

```Scala
def evalState[S, A](st: State[S, A])(s: S): A = st.runState(s)._1
def execState[S, A](st: State[S, A])(s: S): S = st.runState(s)._2
```

However, we can't guarantee right now that the result of an invocation to
`ms_2_ln` is a very well-behaved lens. In fact, we only know that this
implementation compiles nicely! Our mission here consists on proving that the
resulting lens is lawful. How can we state such an argument? Well, we don't
start from scratch here, we are aware that `MonadState` holds some laws that we
could use for this purpose.

Before we dive in, we're going to narrow the scope of the proof, to make things
simpler. Instead of showing the whole correspondence, we'll simply show the
following subproof: for any `State S` instance of `MonadState` where `putPut`
holds, we get a lens where `updateUpdate` holds. Here it's the proof:

```Scala
> [0. update(update(s)(a1))(a2) => update(s)(a2)]
  update(update(s)(a1))(a2)
= [1. def update]
  execState(put(a2))(execState(put(a1))(s))
= [2. Lemma execexec is >>]
  execState(put(a1) >> put(a2))(s)
= [3. putPut (MonadState)]
  execState(put(a2))(s)
= [4. def update]
  update(s)(a2)
â—»
```

We start in *0* with an hypothesis `update(update(s)(a1))(a2)` and a goal
`update(s)(a2)`. Given all the information in the context, that is `MonadState`
laws and other information related to `State`, we should be able to reach that
goal. The step *1* simply unfolds the definition of `update` that we provided in
`ms_2_lens`. Now, in *2*, we assume a lemma *execexec is >>* (which we invite
you to prove) which manifests that sequencing executions of two programs is the
same as the single execution of the sequence of those programs. This leads to
the step *3* where we can apply *putPut* smoothly. Finally, we simply apply the
definition of `update` again in *4*, but this time in a reversed way, to reach
our desired goal. We're done here!

You can find the whole informal proof [here](LensStateIsYourFatherProof.md).
Please, notice that this linked version uses pseudo-haskell notation, which is
more standard in computer science publications.

### Coq Proof

I'm sure you've heard that Coq is a proof assistant but, did you know that it's
also a purely functional language? A very nice one indeed, which comes equipped
with dependent types. Thereby, it's possible to define a lens easily:

```Coq
Record lens (S A : Type) := mkLens
{ view : S -> A
; update : S -> A -> S
}.
```

Now, we're going to encode *putPut* in Coq. You don't have to understand the
details, I just want you to see that this definitions takes a lens as an
argument and returns a law (or *proposition*) over it:

```Coq
Definition update_update {S A : Type} (ln : lens S A) : Prop :=
  forall s a1 a2, update _ _ ln (update _ _ ln s a1) a2 = update _ _ ln s a2.
```

Being a functional language as it is, Coq also enables typeclass definitions.
This is how we represent a `MonadState`. I invite you to come back to the Scala
definition to spot the differences between them:

```Coq
Class MonadState (A : Type) (m : Type -> Type) `{Monad m} : Type :=
{ get : m A
; put : A -> m unit
}.
```

What comes next is quite interesting. We encode the laws of a typeclass in
another class that depends on the original one. In this sense, we should provide
not only an instance of the main typeclass but also an instance of its
associated laws, where we prove that the laws of the main instance hold. I found
this way of encoding laws particularly cool:

```Coq
Class MonadStateLaws (A : Type) (m : Type -> Type) `{MonadState A m} : Type :=
{ get_get : get >>= (fun s1 => get >>= (fun s2 => ret (s1, s2))) =
            get >>= (fun s => ret (s, s))
; get_put : get >>= put = ret tt
; put_get : forall s, put s >> get = put s >> ret s
; put_put : forall s1 s2, put s1 >> put s2 = put s2
}.
```

Defining `state` turns out to be straightforward:

```Coq
Record state (S A : Type) := mkState
{ runState : S -> A * S }.
```

Now, we can write the function that maps any `MonadState A (state S)` into a
`lens S A`, which we'll use in our proof.

```Coq
Definition ms_2_lens {S A : Type} (ms : MonadState A (state S)) : lens S A :=
{| view s := evalState get s
;  update s a := execState (put a) s
|}.
```

And finally here it's the proof:

```Coq
Theorem putput_leads_to_updateupdate :
    forall {S A : Type} (ms : MonadState A (state S)),
    (forall a1 a2, put a1 >> put a2 = put a2) -> update_update (ms_2_lens ms).
Proof.
  intros.
  rename H into putPut.
  unfold update_update.
  unfold ms_2_lens.
  simpl.
  intros.
  rewrite -> execexec_is_gtgt.
  now rewrite -> putPut.
Qed.
```

The header of the proof (from `Theorem` to `Proof`) can be read as: the theorem
*putput_leads_to_updateupdate* proves that for any `ms` belonging to `MonadState
A (state S)`, if `ms` holds *putPut* then `ms_2_lens ms` must hold
*update_update*.

After `Proof` we use the tactics language to prove such a proposition. Again,
you don't have to understand the code, but you could see some counterparts from
the informal proof. Particularly, the `unfold` is quite similar to the expansion
of definitions (step *1* in the informal proof), `rewrite -> execexec_is_gtgt`
corresponds directly with the lemma in step *2* and `rewrite -> putPut` is
exactly the step *3*. The final `Qed` (*quod erat demonstrandum*) evidences the
positive Dna test result that we were searching for. As a consequence, we can
conclude that `State` is the father of `Lens`. ;)

[here](LensStateIsYourFatherProof.v).

## 3. Conclusions

Ok, I buy it, `MonadState A (state S)` is a `lens S A`. *So what?* As I said
previously, "Lens, State Is Your Father" was the starting point of
[*Stateless*](https://github.com/hablapps/stateless), a library that we are
currently working on. In this library, we try to take optics [beyond immutable
data
structures](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/11214-llghtning-talk-optic-algebras-beyond-immutable-data-structures).
Particularly, we want to take the awesome algebra and design patterns from
optics (Lens, Optional, Traversal, etc.) to more general contexts, such as
databases or microservices. We can't do so with lenses, which are restricted to
in-memory data structures, but `MonadState`, containing the algebraic essence of
a lens, opens up these new possibilities, including, but not restricted to
immutable data structures.

We've found it essential to prove that the foundations of Stateless are solid.
However, it was becoming quite annoying to do this task, as proofs were becoming
more complex. This situation inevitably led us to leap of faiths, you know,
everything compiles with pen and paper. That's why we decided to jump into a
proof assistant. Honestly, learning Coq will blow your mind, because it's such a
different beast (although [exactly the
same](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/lf-current/ProofObjects.html) at
the end), but you start to be more confident after one fully immersed week (I
recommend to follow [the dark arrow
itinerary](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/lf-current/deps.html) from
*Logical Foundations*). In my case, it totally worth it, since there's no room
for leap of faiths any more.

Proof assistants are the natural step towards more reliable systems. Given the
nowadays society demands, unit testing is becoming completely obsolete. In this
regard, property based testing is a nice alternative, but we can do better. If
we can prove our software, there's no need for additional tests. It's correct.
Period. Proof assistants are still very academic and they're not necessarily
focused on functional programming, but dependent type languages like Idris are
starting to emerge and [they enable such
capabilities](http://docs.idris-lang.org/en/latest/tutorial/theorems.html). And
here's a new claim that I hope to prove in the future: they're here to stay!
